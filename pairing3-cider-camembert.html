            <h2>Wine</h2>
            <p>
                Normandy Cider is a traditional fermented beverage made from apples, which are abundant in the Normandy
                region of northwestern France. The region's terroir, characterized by its temperate oceanic climate and
                fertile soils, is ideal for apple cultivation. Normandy Cider typically offers a crisp, slightly sweet
                profile with flavors of fresh apples and a gentle effervescence. Its moderate alcohol content and
                refreshing acidity make it an excellent food companion, particularly for rich, creamy cheeses.

            <h2>Cheese</h2>
            <p>
                Camembert de Normandie, an iconic French cheese, originates from the Normandy region. Made from raw
                cow's milk, this soft, creamy cheese is characterized by its edible bloomy rind and a rich, buttery
                flavor. The cheese is aged for a minimum of three weeks, during which its flavors develop and its
                texture becomes increasingly velvety. Camembert de Normandie offers a complex flavor profile, with notes
                of earthiness, mushrooms, and a hint of barnyard, all underpinned by the cheese's natural creaminess.
                The unique taste of Camembert de Normandie is a result of the lush, nutrient-rich pastures in the
                region, where the cows graze.

            <h2>Pairing Experience</h2>
            <p>
                The pairing of Normandy Cider and Camembert de Normandie creates a delightful contrast of flavors and
                textures, showcasing the best of the Normandy region's terroir. The cider's acidity and fruitiness cut
                through the creaminess of the Camembert, providing a pleasant contrast that highlights the distinct
                flavors of both the beverage and the cheese. The cider's effervescence acts as a palate cleanser,
                refreshing the taste buds and enhancing the enjoyment of the Camembert's rich, earthy flavors. This
                pairing offers a taste of Normandy's culinary heritage, highlighting the region's exceptional apples and
                the artisanal craftsmanship involved in the production of Camembert de Normandie.
