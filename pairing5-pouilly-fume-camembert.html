            <h2>Wine</h2>
            <p>
                Pouilly-Fumé is a renowned white wine that comes from the Loire Valley in central France. It is produced
                solely from Sauvignon Blanc grapes grown on the eastern side of the Loire River, around the village of
                Pouilly-sur-Loire. Pouilly-Fumé's terroir is characterized by its cool climate and diverse soils
                (limestone, marl, and flint), which contribute to the wine's distinct minerality and complexity. The
                wine is often described as having "gunflint" or "smoky" notes, along with flavors of green apple,
                citrus, and sometimes a touch of herbs. Its bright acidity and full body make Pouilly-Fumé an excellent
                pairing partner for a variety of cheeses.

            <h2>Cheese</h2>
            <p>
                Camembert de Normandie, an iconic French cheese, originates from the Normandy region. Made from raw
                cow's milk, this soft, creamy cheese is characterized by its edible bloomy rind and a rich, buttery
                flavor. The cheese is aged for a minimum of three weeks, during which its flavors develop and its
                texture becomes increasingly velvety. Camembert de Normandie offers a complex flavor profile, with notes
                of earthiness, mushrooms, and a hint of barnyard, all underpinned by the cheese's natural creaminess.
                The unique taste of Camembert de Normandie is a result of the lush, nutrient-rich pastures in the
                region, where the cows graze.

            <h2>Pairing Experience</h2>
            <p>
                The pairing of Pouilly-Fumé and Camembert de Normandie is a celebration of French terroir and tradition.
                The wine's crisp acidity and citrus flavors cut through the cheese's creamy richness, creating a
                balanced and harmonious tasting experience. The Pouilly-Fumé's distinctive minerality and subtle
                herbaceousness complement the earthy, mushroom-like notes of the Camembert, while the wine's full body
                holds up against the cheese's robust character. This combination of flavors showcases the distinctive
                terroir and skilled craftsmanship of the Loire Valley and Normandy, creating a culinary experience
                that's quintessentially French.
